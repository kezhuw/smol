/// more advisable to create your own [`crate::Executor`].
///
/// By default, the global executor is run by a single background thread, but you can also
/// configure the number of threads by setting the `SMOL_THREADS` environment variable.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let task = smol::spawn(async {
///     1 + 2
/// });
///
/// smol::block_on(async {
///     assert_eq!(task.await, 3);
/// });
/// ```
